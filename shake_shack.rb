IMAGINE THAT WE RUN A MILKSHAKE BUSSINES AND 
WE WANT TO CHECKOUT THE PRICE OF AN INDIVIDUAL MILKSHAKE
AND ALSO THE PRICE FOR THE SUM OF A FEW MILKSHAKES IN CASE
A FAMILY OR GROUP OF FRIENDS COMES TO OUR SHOP.
THE FOLLOWING CODE CAN DO IT FOR US
THIS CODE HAS 3 DIFERENT CLASSES WHICH I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN
CLASS BY CLASS
